### What you need

- An SD Card or USB Drive

1. Download the latest version of the WiiLink Patcher for your operating system.

2. Launch the patcher and begin the download process by selecting "Express Install Setup"".
> Make sure your SD Card/USB Drive is connected to your Computer in order for the Patcher to automatically send your files to your Wii's SD Card/USB Drive.
3. After the Patcher is done downloading the files, simply disconnect your SD Card/USB Drive from your Computer, and input it into your Wii/Wii U.

4. Start up the Homebrew Channel and enter yawmME (YAWM ModMii Edition).

5. Highlight the WAD with `Nintendo Channel (WiiLink)` or `Minna no Nintendo Channel (WiiLink)` as its name and press + to select it. When it is selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
> The WAD name might also have `[USA]`, `[PAL]`, or `[Japan]` depending on what region of Console youre installing the Channel on. Please install the correct region version of the Channel on your Console.
#### If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Nintendo Channel (WiiLink)` or "Minna no Nintendo Channel (WiiLink)", uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.

6. After it is successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel. Press the HOME Button again and select `"Exit to System Menu"`.
