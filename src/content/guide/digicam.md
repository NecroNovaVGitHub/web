## Installation Guide

### What you need

- An SD Card or USB Drive
- A Wii with an Internet Connection
- A Windows, Mac, or Linux Computer
- [WiiLink Patcher](https://github.com/WiiLink24/WiiLink24-Patcher)

1. Download the latest version of the WiiLink Patcher for your operating system.

2. Launch the patcher and begin the download process by selecting "Express Install Setup"".

> Make sure your SD Card/USB Drive is connected to your Computer in order for the Patcher to automatically send your files to your Wii's SD Card/USB Drive.

3. After the Patcher is done downloading the files, simply disconnect your SD Card/USB Drive from your Computer, and input it into your Wii/Wii U.

4. Start up the Homebrew Channel and enter yawmME (YAWM ModMii Edition).

5. Highlight the WAD with `Photo Prints Channel (English)` or `Digicam Print Channel (Japan)` (depending on your Console Region) and `WiiLink SPD` as its name and press + to select them. When all of them are selected, press A twice to install the WADs.
> The `WiiLink SPD` file should have either `(Wii)` or `(vWii)` in its name depending on the Console you're installing it on.
#### If you happen to get `Error -1022` when installing `Photo Prints Channel (English)` or `Digicam Print Channel (Japan)`, uninstall the channel by selecting the WAD with `-` and pressing `A`. Then, re-install the WAD.

7. After it is successfully installed, press the HOME Button to exit back to the Homebrew Channel. Press the HOME Button again and select `"Exit to System Menu"`.

### Congrats! You've installed the Photo Prints Channel on your Console! Enjoy the Channel to your hearts content!

## Troubleshooting & Questions
### "Are the photos directly mailed to me?"
> No. We use the email address you have registered via Set Personal Data.
> Your photos are rendered on our server, and a ZIP file is emailed directly to you.

> If you want your Photos printed, you will have to do that yourself with a Printer.

### "The Photo Prints Channel is telling me that my selected image is not supported!"

> Photo Print only supports "baseline" (not "progressive", or "interlaced") JPEGs. Here are some tips to make your photo compatible:
- Using Photoshop:

    - Go to File > Export > Save for Web (Legacy)

     - Change the format to JPEG. Make sure to uncheck 'Progressive' and 'Optimized'.

- Using Paint.NET:
    - Go to File -> Save As...

    - Change the 'Save as type' to JPEG, and save.

    - You do not need to change any options - Paint.NET does not support progressive JPEG, and will save as baseline.
 
### "I got an Error saying 'The SPD app was not found.'!"
> This means you did not install the "Set Personal Data" App found after getting it from the patcher. Simply install the application using a Wad Manager, and try using the Channel again.
> 
### "I didnt get an Email from the Channel!"
>Email's may take up to 10 or more minutes after finishing a Photo order on the Channel. Please be patient with the wait time.

### "Photo Print is telling me that my address is within 'Dallas, TX'?"
> This is the default address. Please change it in the "Set Personal Data" App.

### "I use Dolphin. My photos or Miis sometimes become black. What can I do?"
> Within Dolphin's graphics settings, disable the setting "Store XFB Copies to Texture Only".
