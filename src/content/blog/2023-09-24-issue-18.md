Hey Guys & Gals alike reading this, i'm Nova and i'm here to talk about the News on what's happened for WiiLink in the past few months!

#### Wii Mail (Wii Message Board) has officially been released!

For our newest addition to our WC24 Revivals, we are happy to annouce that Wii Mail has released! You all can now send messages to your Wii Friends once again with our Mail service!

We even support other online functionality for games/applications that include Mail! Heres a small list of whats currently working;

- Wii -> Wii
- Email -> Wii (& vice versa with Wii -> Email)
- Mario Kart Wii (Ghost Data & Sending Friend Requests)
- Photo Channel (Exchanging Photos with Friends)
- Wii Room (Sending Room messages to Friends)

You can check for a more up to date and larger compatibility list over at the page for the Wii Message Board! We hope you enjoy using our service for Wii Mail/Wii Message Board!

#### Major Site Re-Writing & Redesign time!

If you've noticed, the entire site has been redesigned from square one, AND we've given it a major re-writing as well! We did this because the entire team felt like the entire site was growing VERY outdated, so we updated it!

Every page should include an Installation Guide, so that way you can get the easiest way on how to install an application, as well as on how to update it! The site should also be more accessable now, and snazzier too!

#### Everybody Votes Channel Release & Maintenance...

We recently released the Everybody Votes Channel last month as another addition to our WC24 Revivals. Unfortunetly, due to some internal problems, the application became unusable after a couple weeks. Therefore, we have put a temporary maintenace on the Channel, to fix every issue possible that has occured for users.

We are very sorry for the inconvience on the channel, and we intend to work very hard on it for the future.

#### Kirby TV, is that you again (again)?!

To everyone who couldn't get the Kirby TV Channel working before, its finally back up & running! The schedule has been reset and Episodes should now be playing on the Channel again (again)!

The issue with the Channel that plagued its re-runs before was on the server side of things. Now that it has been fixed, you can all continue watching Kirby on your Wii again (again)!

#### Food Channel (Demae) Deliveroo Discontinuation...

Recently, the developers of the Food Channel have made the very unfortunate decision to permanently discontinue the Deliveroo service for the Food Channel.

As quoted from our project lead:

"The issue that we encountered is that Deliveroo could detect us sending out multiple requests at once and instantly terminated our connection to their server. Our attempts at lengthening the intervals at which we send out the requests caused the server to be too slow, making the channel timeout."

Entering the Deliveroo version of the Food Channel now will give you a Discontinuation Message in Japanese.
We're extremely sorry for the inconvenience from this Service. Thank you for understanding why we have shut it down.

## That's all, Folks!

Thank you for reading the latest edition of the WiiLink Newsletter! See ya'll next Issue, and catch up on WiiLink's content while you're waiting!
